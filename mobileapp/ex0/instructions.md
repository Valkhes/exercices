# Fizzbuzz instructions

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to N. N is given as argument to the program. But for multiples of three print “fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “buzz” instead of the number. For numbers which are multiples of **both** three and five print “fizzbuzz” instead of the number.
